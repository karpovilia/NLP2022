## Pruning: Motivation
Trillion of synapses are generated in the **human brain** during the first few months of birth. [Christopher A. Walsh Peter Huttenlocher (1931â€“2013)](https://www.nature.com/articles/502172a)

- 1 year old, peaked at 1000 trillion
- Pruning begins to occur.
- 10 years old, a child has nearly 500 trillion synapses
- This 'pruning' mechanism removes redundant connections in the brain.
